# MakerLab Project
### Scheduling System for CaMS 3-D Printers
Our department owns 7 3-D printers of various makes and models.  Some our housed in our Maker Lab and some are housed in the robotics lab.
We would like a system that would allow authorized users to reserve printers for a specified time period.  The scheduling system should be 
web-based and mobile friendly.  Other requirements include:
- Online schedule availability
- Users can reserve tools
- Administrator can view historical schedule
- Generate activity reports

We are running [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/) on the printers in the Robot Lab.  If there is time, we would like to integrate that into the scheduling system.
